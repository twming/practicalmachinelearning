This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}

```

```{r}

```


```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Include library for the machine learning
```{r}
library(caret)
library(useful)
```

Read the train and test data
```{r datatrain = read.csv("pml-training.csv")}
datatrain = read.csv("pml-training.csv")
datatest = read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
```

Data exploration to understand the data range of each feature
```{r summary(datatrain)}

```
